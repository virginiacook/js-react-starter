# js-starter with react

This project allows a user to create a blog with various posts that contain a title, content, and tags. I implemented all of the baseline features. I had some trouble initially understanding how various redux components fit into react, but eventually got the hang of it.

## Extra credit

I implemented error checking to ensure that the user does not try to create a post without all of the values, and I tried to make my blog look nice, going for a more simple style.
